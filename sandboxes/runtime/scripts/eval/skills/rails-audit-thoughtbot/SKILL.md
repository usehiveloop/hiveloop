description: Perform comprehensive code audits of Ruby on Rails applications based on thoughtbot best practices. Use this skill when the user requests a code audit, code review, quality assessment, or analysis of a Rails application. The skill analyzes the entire codebase focusing on testing practices (Rails default Minitest in this runtime), security vulnerabilities, code design (skinny controllers, domain models, PORO with ActiveModel), Rails conventions, database optimization, and Ruby best practices. Outputs a detailed markdown audit report grouped by category (Testing, Security, Models, Controllers, Code Design, Views) with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) within each category.

# Rails Audit Skill (thoughtbot Best Practices)

Perform comprehensive Ruby on Rails application audits based on thoughtbot's Ruby Science and Testing Rails best practices, with emphasis on Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs) over Service Objects.

## Audit Scope

The audit can be run in two modes:
1. **Full Application Audit**: Analyze entire Rails application
2. **Targeted Audit**: Analyze specific files or directories

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Determine Audit Scope

Ask user or infer from request:
- Full audit: Analyze all of `app/`, `spec/` or `test/`, `config/`, `db/`, `lib/`
- Targeted audit: Analyze specified paths only

### Step 2: Autonomous Metrics Policy

This Hivy eval runs autonomously for non-technical users. Do not ask the user whether to collect metrics. Skip optional SimpleCov and RubyCritic collection unless the tools are already installed and can run without changing application behavior. Prefer direct code inspection plus existing Rails test results.

### Step 3: Load Reference Materials

Before analyzing, read the relevant reference files:
- `references/code_smells.md` - Code smell patterns to identify
- `references/testing_guidelines.md` - Testing best practices
- `references/poro_patterns.md` - PORO and ActiveModel patterns
- `references/security_checklist.md` - Security vulnerability patterns
- `references/rails_antipatterns.md` - Rails-specific antipatterns (external services, migrations, performance)

### Step 4: Analyze Code by Category

Analyze in this order:

1. **Testing Coverage & Quality**
   - If SimpleCov data was collected in Step 2, use actual coverage percentages instead of estimates
   - Cross-reference per-file SimpleCov data: files with 0% coverage = "missing tests"
   - Check for missing test files
   - Identify untested public methods
   - Review test structure (Four Phase Test)
   - Check for testing antipatterns

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - SQL injection risks
   - Mass assignment vulnerabilities
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Authentication/authorization issues
   - Sensitive data exposure

3. **Models & Database**
   - Fat model detection
   - Missing validations
   - N+1 query risks
   - Callback complexity
   - Law of Demeter violations (voyeuristic models)
   - If RubyCritic data was collected, flag models with D/F ratings or high complexity

4. **Controllers**
   - Fat controller detection
   - Business logic in controllers
   - Missing strong parameters
   - Response handling
   - Monolithic controllers (non-RESTful actions, > 7 actions)
   - Bloated sessions (storing objects instead of IDs)
   - If RubyCritic data was collected, flag controllers with D/F ratings or high complexity

5. **Code Design & Architecture**
   - Service Objects → recommend PORO refactoring
   - Large classes
   - Long methods
   - Feature envy
   - Law of Demeter violations
   - Single Responsibility violations
   - If RubyCritic data was collected, cross-reference D/F rated files and high-complexity files with manual code review findings

6. **Views & Presenters**
   - Logic in views (PHPitis)
   - Missing partials for DRY
   - Helper complexity
   - Query logic in views

7. **External Services & Error Handling**
   - Fire and forget (missing exception handling for HTTP calls)
   - Sluggish services (missing timeouts, synchronous calls that should be backgrounded)
   - Bare rescue statements
   - Silent failures (save without checking return value)

8. **Database & Migrations**
   - Messy migrations (model references, missing down methods)
   - Missing indexes on foreign keys, polymorphic associations, uniqueness validations
   - Performance antipatterns (Ruby iteration vs SQL queries)
   - Bulk operations without transactions

### Step 5: Generate Audit Report

Create `RAILS_AUDIT_REPORT.md` in project root with structure defined in `references/report_template.md`.

When SimpleCov coverage data was collected in Step 2, use the **SimpleCov variant** of the Testing section in the report template. When coverage data is not available, use the **estimation variant**.

When RubyCritic data was collected in Step 2b, include the **Code Quality Metrics** section in the report using the RubyCritic variant from the report template. When RubyCritic data is not available, use the **not available variant**.

## Severity Definitions

- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, production-breaking issues
- **High**: Performance issues, missing tests for critical paths, major code smells
- **Medium**: Code smells, convention violations, maintainability concerns
- **Low**: Style issues, minor improvements, suggestions

## Key Detection Patterns

### Service Object → PORO Refactoring

When you find classes in `app/services/`:
- Classes named `*Service`, `*Manager`, `*Handler`
- Classes with only `.call` or `.perform` methods
- Recommend: Rename to domain nouns, include `ActiveModel::Model`

### Fat Model Detection

Models with:
- More than 200 lines
- More than 15 public methods
- Multiple unrelated responsibilities
- Recommend: Extract to POROs using composition

### Fat Controller Detection

Controllers with:
- Actions over 15 lines
- Business logic (not request/response handling)
- Multiple instance variable assignments
- Recommend: Extract to form objects or domain models

### Missing Test Detection

For each Ruby file in `app/`:
- Check for corresponding `_spec.rb` or `_test.rb`
- Check for tested public methods
- Report untested files and methods

## Analysis Commands

Use Claude Code's built-in tools instead of shell commands — they're faster, handle permissions correctly, and give better output:

- **Find Ruby files by type**: Use the Glob tool with patterns like `app/models/**/*.rb`, `app/controllers/**/*.rb`, `app/services/**/*.rb`
- **Find test files**: Use Glob with `spec/**/*_spec.rb` or `test/**/*_test.rb`
- **Search for patterns in code**: Use the Grep tool (e.g., search for `rescue\s*$`, `\.save\b`, `params\.permit!`)
- **Read and count lines in files**: Use the Read tool to inspect files; count lines from the output
- **Find long files**: Use Glob to list all `app/**/*.rb` files, then Read each to check line count

## Report Output

Always save the audit report to `RAILS_AUDIT_REPORT.md` in the project root and present it to the user.
